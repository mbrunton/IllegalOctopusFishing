Extreme Sailing

TODO: implement app controls (tilting tablet for steering, swiping screen up/down to adjust sail slack)
- currently uses keyboard (left, right arrows to steer, up, down arrows to adjust sail slack)

Objective: sail around and avoid getting shot by the coast guard
- sailing is realistic (speed is determined by angle between sail and wind, wind strength, and whether wind is in front or behind)
- fire harpoons with space
- avoid getting shot
- boat can go on land (this is EXTREME sailing)s
